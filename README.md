💧 AquaGrid – Smart Water Management System
🚀 Overview

AquaGrid is a cloud-connected Smart IoT Water Management System designed to monitor, control, and optimize water distribution between two geographically separated locations.

The system enables real-time monitoring, intelligent pump automation, redundancy management, and remote access through a centralized dashboard.

🎯 Problem Statement

Manual monitoring of water distribution between locations leads to:

Delayed response during shortages

Poor inter-location coordination

Pump failures without backup activation

Water wastage and inefficiency

AquaGrid solves this using IoT, cloud communication, and automation.
